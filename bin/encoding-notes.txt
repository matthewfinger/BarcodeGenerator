upc (universal product code) encoding:
7-bits, 4 'generalized bars'

a generalized bar is a group of all white or all black bars such that it looks like one bar

Left-Side, odd parity:
{
0: 0001101,
1: 0011001,
2: 0010011,
3: 0111101,
4: 0100011,
5: 0110001,
6: 0101111,
7: 0111011,
8: 0110111,
9: 0001011,
}

-given an odd parity encoding, the even parity can be found by reversing the n-bit binary string, and inversing it such that the negatives become positive, and vice-versa

-given a left side encoding, the right side can be found by inversing the n-bit binary strings, such that the negatives become positive, and vice-versa.

UPC-A codes consist of 12 digits:
  -6 left (odd parity) & 6 right digits





EAN-13 (european article number) Encoding:

barcodes represent a 13-digit number

12 digits are independent, the 13th and last digit is a check digit determined from the former 12

the first digit determines the order of parities for the following 6 digits

the last 6 digits are all encoded with right -side upc encoding

the parities (even->E, odd->O) for the 6 digits following the first digit are as follows:

{
0: OOOOOO,
1: OOEOEE,
2: OOEEOE,
3: OOEEEO,
4: OEOOEE,
5: OEEOOE,
6: OEEEOO,
7: OEOEOE,
8: OEOEEO,
9: OEEOEO
}

Note that, if one were to construct a function D, that maps the digit & pariety/side to a given 7-bit binary encoding, it would be a 1:1, bijective function. Therefore, from any 7-bit encoding, it is possible to determine the pariety/side. That being said, the first digit is implicitly encoded, since it can be determined from the parieties of the following 6 digits.

each ean-13 code has a start and an end marker, both denoted as 101
